What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, it allows me to track all files and changes I made
from that point of initialization forward.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

staging area is a pre-commit area where files are ready to be committed to the
repository. It allows you to bundle files into a group because sometimes you
working in files as a group and not just individually.
